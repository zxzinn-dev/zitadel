# Login App Theme Customization Guide

This guide helps you customize the appearance of your ZITADEL login application for a personalized user experience.

## Quick Start

1. Copy the theme variables you want to customize from `.env.theme.example` to your `.env.local` file
2. Restart your application
3. Your theme changes will be applied automatically

## Theme Options

### 🔄 Roundness (`NEXT_PUBLIC_THEME_ROUNDNESS`)

Controls how rounded the UI elements appear:

- **`edgy`** - Sharp, rectangular corners (modern tech, corporate)
- **`mid`** - Medium rounded corners (balanced, professional)
- **`full`** - Fully rounded corners (friendly, approachable)

### 📱 Layout (`NEXT_PUBLIC_THEME_LAYOUT`)

Controls the overall page structure:

- **`side-by-side`** - Brand section on left, form on right (desktop view)
- **`top-to-bottom`** - Brand section on top, form below (mobile-first)

### 📏 Spacing (`NEXT_PUBLIC_THEME_SPACING`)

Controls spacing and padding throughout the interface:

- **`regular`** - Standard spacing with comfortable padding (p-6, space-y-6)
- **`compact`** - Tighter spacing for information-dense layouts (p-4, space-y-4)

### 🎨 Appearance (`NEXT_PUBLIC_THEME_APPEARANCE`)

Complete design philosophies:

- **`flat`** - Minimal flat design with cards matching background color, subtle borders, and normal typography
- **`material`** - Material Design inspired with elevated cards, proper contrast, and medium typography

### 🖼️ Background Image (`NEXT_PUBLIC_THEME_BACKGROUND_IMAGE`)

Add a custom background image:

- Use local images: `/images/my-background.jpg` (place in `public/images/`)
- Use external URLs: `https://example.com/background.jpg`
- Leave empty for solid color backgrounds

## Example Settings

NEXT_PUBLIC_THEME_ROUNDNESS=full

## Advanced Customization

### Organization-specific motion

The login container can select one decorative motion preset per organization at runtime. Configure
`LOGIN_MOTION_PROFILES` with ZITADEL organization IDs; a new image is not required when the mapping changes.

```env
LOGIN_MOTION_PROFILES={"default":"none","organizations":{"123456789":"aurora","987654321":"orbit"}}
```

Supported presets are `none`, `aurora`, and `orbit`. Unknown presets and malformed JSON fail closed to `none`.
The scene choreography uses Motion for React so module assembly, SVG route drawing, signals, progress, and labels
share one deterministic timeline instead of independent CSS animation loops. The motion layer is decorative, ignores
pointer input, and becomes a static resolved scene when the browser requests reduced motion. Keep `default` set to
`none` unless every organization has approved animated login artwork.

The Login app receives the organization context through the existing `organization` query parameter. Ensure the
OIDC authorization request includes an organization scope or otherwise establishes organization context before the
login route is rendered.

For more detailed customization beyond these presets, you can:

1. **Custom CSS**: Add your own CSS files in the `src/styles/` directory
2. **Component Override**: Modify the theme settings in `src/lib/theme.ts`
3. **Custom Appearances**: Add new appearance options to the `APPEARANCE_STYLES` or `SPACING_STYLES` objects

## Troubleshooting

### Theme not applying

- Ensure you're using `NEXT_PUBLIC_` prefix for all theme variables (`NEXT_PUBLIC_THEME_ROUNDNESS`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_THEME_SPACING`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_THEME_APPEARANCE`, etc.)
- Restart your development server after changing environment variables
- Check that your `.env.local` file is in the root of the login app directory

### Background image not loading

- Verify the image path is correct
- For external URLs, ensure the domain is accessible
- Check browser console for any loading errors

### Layout issues on mobile

- Test your theme on different screen sizes
- The `top-to-bottom` layout is generally more mobile-friendly
- Some combinations work better on certain screen sizes
